# OYO Japan Frontend Assignment

Thank you for applying to join OYO Japan! To help us assess your technical skills, understanding of web fundamentals and ability to interpret requirements, we would like you to complete a short assignment.

**Please note:** This is your own personal repository. You can use and interact in the same way you would if you were contributing to a project with a team.

## Background

Our product team has conceived a new website to serve fans of Japan’s most beloved cuisine - Ramen! They’re betting big that this one will go viral, spread awareness and help drive traffic to our hotels site.

The idea is simple: A single page application which lists the top 12 ramen restaurants in the Tokyo area. A text input allows users to optionally filter the results by keyword (location, shop name etc.).

## Requirements

You should adhere to the following technical requirements:

- Use the provided repository
- Use JavaScript or TypeScript
- Use a framework (React would be preferable)
- Use the Hot Pepper Gourmet API (https://webservice.recruit.co.jp/doc/hotpepper/reference.html)

And the following functional requirements:

- Default to all Ramen shops in Tokyo
- Include a keyword filter (this should query the API again)
- Display up to 12 results (you do not need to implement pagination)
- Restaurant cards should contain the following information:
    - Shop Name
    - Address
    - Ranking (representing position in current list)
    - Image
    - Catch copy
    - More details link
    - **One additional detail of your choice which you think would be important for users**

You will receive bonus points if you can include the following:

- Documentation of all assumptions made
- Consideration of ‘no results’ and ‘error’ states
- Adaption of the design to support varying screen widths (responsive design)
- Tests (Unit, Integration or E2E)

## Design

Figma link: https://www.figma.com/file/OSQLQ2QW5NG9qJKbJjhHoT/frontend-assigment-shagun-chaurasia?node-id=0%3A1

We have provided a Figma design for you to work from. You should match this as closely as possible but make any adjustments as necessary to complete your task in a timely manner.

Any required assets should be exportable from the Figma design.


## API Information

You can register for an API key here: https://webservice.recruit.co.jp/register and view the documentation here: https://webservice.recruit.co.jp/doc/hotpepper/reference.html.

You will be expected to discover the appropriate service area and genre codes to meet the product requirements yourself.

## How will you be assessed?

- Adherence to requirements
- Code quality (architecture, style, functionality)
- UI/UX considerations
- Documentation quality
- Implementation accuracy

## Submission Process

Submit your work with any commits/branches/issues/pull requests to this GitHub repository (it’s private you!). Please do not fork this repo.

Please include a README if there are any special steps required for us to install/run/test your project.

We’d like you to submit the assignment within 10 days of receipt, but it shouldn’t take that long to complete.
